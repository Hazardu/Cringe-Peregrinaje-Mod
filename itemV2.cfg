description = "A trimmed version of cringe pere mod with just QoL, without weapon, boon and career changes.


Changes:


- Added toggles to remove abduction, ulgu's deception, darkness of heresy from map modifiers.
- Added toggles to remove nugles curse miasma and tzeentch randomized size curses
- Removed enemies staggering players when they climb.
- Patched many cheese spots on chaos wastes maps by placing invisible walls.
- Undid the block angle change, you can block attacks coming from the back again.
- On hardest difficulty you cannot get reward map modifiers like +coins and +chests with -modifiers that make the node easier. 
- Made a spot on pit of reflections - skittergate part - second tome parcour easier - the second jump required stepping on pixel wide gap
- All traits and properties in athanor are unlocked from level 1.*
- [strike]Mastery points to allocate in athanor increased to 3200 from 2650.[/strike] Halved mastery costs*
*Peregrinaje author keeps changing his code daily to prevent those two changes from taking place, and I cant be bothered with this anymore. I am making one last workaround for them to work with the current version but its considerably worse than previous clean implementations. Sorry for inconvieniences.
